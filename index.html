                                                        year's resolution. I had my first class on Human Computer
                                                        Interaction on 6<sup>th</sup> February 2023. It was a really
                                                        interesting lecture as I always wondered about the heuristics

                                                        sparked in me the basic understanding of human perspective to

                                                        it's mostly project based, which makes it look so fun!</p>

                                                        wanted to stay on top of this, so while having lunch today at
                                                        Passion, I spoke with a few friends of mine about what potential

                                                        really interesting feedback from my friends. Quite a lot of
                                                        problems at UST haha! I'm not much of a gymmer, but one of my
                                                        friends is and he was so passionate about the need to reform the
                                                        gym system. I felt so intrigued hearing that and was totally
                                                        convinced that this is the topic I want to work on. But again,
                                                        like I said, I'm not a gymmer, so I didn't relate strongly with
                                                        the topic. Another friend of mine suggested that it's so
                                                        annoying when they feel like studying and decide to sit in the
                                                        library, travel all the way from their halls to the LC, only to
                                                        find out that it's at capacity and there's no more seating
                                                        available. Well, this problem could have been easily solved by
                                                        counting the number of Student ID taps on their entry system,
                                                        however, there's no tap done to count their exit so this won't
                                                        be a possible project to work on. Another one of my friends
                                                        suggested to improve the HKUST AirCon recharging system as it's
                                                        a three step process which is pretty annoying, however, TKO
                                                        Hall, in which I live in, has already simplified the system by
                                                        making use of Octopus Cards instead.</p>

                                                        Today, I had an interesting interaction with one of my friends,
                                                        he recently broke up with his girlfriend and were super sad as
                                                        they also missed the deadline for USThing's Valentine's Match.
                                                        He was very sad. While I consoled him, I also got the idea of
                                                        reforming the USThing Valentine's Matchmaking by decentralizing
                                                        the user profiles and making the match making process more
                                                        transparent. I ended up pitching this idea to my groupmates
                                                        which got all of us very excited as it clearly caters to the
                                                        huge number of single people at HKUST. But since, a lot of my
                                                        groupmates are exchange students and have no idea whatsoever
                                                        about USThing's Valentine's Day Matchmaking, we had to drop the
                                                        idea. We also discussed if we could work on UST's laundry
                                                        system, as similar to the AirCon system, it's pretty outdated.
                                                        But again, in my JCH, it's pretty convenient. So we decided to
                                                        drop the idea.

                                                        Today, we had the in-class activity where we are supposed to
                                                        brainstorm on ideas and create our mindmap. We had very limited
                                                        time, so we made use of our research and interactions so far to
                                                        make the mindmap as quickly as we could. This is what we came up
                                                        with: - <br>

                                                        Here we also thought that we could revamp the Student
                                                        Information System or SIS, but we realized that it was a really
                                                        common topic when other groups presented. We were all very
                                                        tired, so we decided to have lunch at the LG1 canteen. But there
                                                        was a massive crowd there as it was peak lunch hours. We
                                                        couldn't even find a single empty table to accomodate our group.
                                                        And that's when we zeroed down to working on <b>Enhancing HKUST
                                                                Canteen Experience</b>. We realized that we're not the
                                                        only ones facing the problem, there's hundreds of other students
                                                        who're so tired of the lack of information HKUST's Canteens
                                                        provide. So we decided to send develop our questionnaire and
                                                        send it out to our groupchats to gather people's perspective and
                                                        validate if our experiences match theirs. By the end of the day,
                                                        we were able to create the following google form to survey

                                                        Based on the responses we collected, I was able to ideate

                                                        non-user-friendly canteen experience. It looks like this: -<br>

                                                        Based off the questionnaire, I was able to assess what kind of
                                                        persona our users have, those who primarily belong to the
                                                        student group. I came up with the following characteristics that

                                                The questionnaire also allowed me to identify problems related to the

                                                        This also made me ponder what's the best way to implement this
                                                        reform,
                                                        should I create a new application, maybe create a virtual
                                                        queuing
                                                        system, what about work with just a single vendor, maybe just
                                                        focus of
                                                        availabiliy of seats system, etc. I realized that this all can
                                                        be
                                                        combined into a single page on HKUST Student's App which is
                                                        already
                                                        installed in most of our primary user's (students) devices. A
                                                        simple
                                                        task breakdown would invlove pitching a collaboration with HKUST
                                                        Student's Application, collect statistics to validate our
                                                        claims,
                                                        collaborate with the canteen vendors, configure their POS
                                                        systems to
                                                        push information about stock to our API which we develop to
                                                        standardize
                                                        information transmission. And finally design a page in HKUST
                                                        Student's
                                                        App that can connect with this information. This clear approach
                                                        of working systematically and getting to know your customers and
                                                        their behaviour was pretty important to me as I was able to
                                                        solve a lot of questions I was getting while I was simply
                                                        thinking of the idea. Who better to ask for answers than the
                                                        users themselves! We then started working on our storyboarding
                                                        and presentation.

                                                        motivated to use up leftover foods in order to reduce
                                                        food
                                                        waste. We seek to address both of these problems by
                                                        developing a
                                                        chatbot that suggests recipes depending on available
                                                        ingredients. We firmly think that by easing the stress
                                                        and
                                                        enhancing the enjoyment of meals, we can enhance
                                                        people's
                                                        general well-being. Statistically speaking, 54% of 52
                                                        respondents we surveyed were interested in a

                                                        that could map to the potential target users. I came up

                                                        Our chatbot prototype's first iteration had a simple
                                                        functionality that let it ask the user for their dietary
                                                        restrictions and preferred ingredients before returning
                                                        appropriate recipes. To make our chatbot more engaging
                                                        and
                                                        user-friendly, we conducted two rounds of user usability
                                                        testing
                                                        and learned a lot about where we needed to make
                                                        improvements.
                                                        We used co-discovery and thinking out loud protocols
                                                        during the

                                                        chatbot. We also tested several features, including
                                                        asking for a
                                                        recipe, listing ingredients, listing dietary

                                                        starting a new recipe. These tests helped us identify

                                                        Now, we started testing the first prototype with real
                                                        users to
                                                        gather valuable feedback.
                                                        We discovered a number of problems that were degrading

                                                        experience when evaluating Recipe Chatbot V1. Initially,
                                                        we
                                                        found that consumers were unsure of the chatbot's
                                                        required
                                                        inputs and that the cues were imprecise. All two users
                                                        admitted
                                                        to not knowing how to launch the chatbot and begin the
                                                        recipe
                                                        search. For instance, consumers were unaware that in
                                                        order to
                                                        activate the chatbot, they had to begin with a
                                                        particular
                                                        phrase, such as "I want a recipe." We also found that
                                                        users had
                                                        to reload the tab in order to start a new recipe search.
                                                        The
                                                        ingredients from the previous recipe would continue to
                                                        appear,
                                                        which confused them and made it
                                                        challenging to launch a new search.
                                                        Last but not least, there was no error handling or
                                                        messaging in
                                                        the chatbot to alert users when a search returned no
                                                        results or
                                                        when there was a mistake. The chatbot would advise
                                                        users to try some recipes while failing to provide any
                                                        results
                                                        for a vegan chicken sandwich. Users were left confused
                                                        by this
                                                        and unsure of whether the chatbot was functioning
                                                        properly, and
                                                        they received no guidance on what to do next.<br><br>
                                                        Following these feedbacks, We made major changes to our
                                                        chatbot in the second iteration in order
                                                        to improve the user experience. Sample queries were one
                                                        of the
                                                        major adjustments we made to the welcome message to
                                                        better
                                                        inform users about how to communicate with the chatbot.
                                                        By doing
                                                        so, the chatbot's goal was made clearer and users'
                                                        expectations
                                                        were established right away.
                                                        We also added continuous question-prompting to help
                                                        users
                                                        navigate the recipe search process. This made it
                                                        possible for
                                                        people to make conclusions about their recipe search
                                                        that were
                                                        well-informed and took into account all the options. To

                                                        assist customers in finding certain recipes they were
                                                        interested
                                                        in, we included capability for recipe search by name.
                                                        Finally, to help control user expectations and avoid
                                                        irritation,
                                                        we added a response if no recipes were located. The
                                                        chatbot
                                                        became more user-friendly to user needs as a
                                                        result of this functionality, which suggested alternate

                                                        choices to them.
                                                        Overall, these modifications helped our chatbot become
                                                        more
                                                        useful to consumers by enhancing its usability and
                                                        functionality.<br><br>
                                                        In the second round of user testing for our prototype,
                                                        we
                                                        concentrated on making the chatbot more logical and
                                                        user-friendly. The sample queries we implemented made
                                                        the chatbot easier to operate, according to our tests.
                                                        Users
                                                        also valued the additional personal touch of Remy's
                                                        picture,
                                                        which made the chatbot seem friendlier and more
                                                        interesting. It added to the cuteness factor.
                                                        We significantly improved the functionality and
                                                        usability of the
                                                        chatbot by enabling users to search for
                                                        recipes by food names. Users could now quickly search
                                                        recipes
                                                        based on particular components or dishes they were
                                                        interested in
                                                        thanks to this new functionality.
                                                        But, we also discovered persistent problems that the
                                                        chatbot's
                                                        further revisions would need to fix. They included
                                                        strengthening
                                                        the chatbot's ability to handle errors, expanding the
                                                        search
                                                        results' level of detail, and speeding up the chatbot's
                                                        response
                                                        time. By addressing these concerns, we expect to further
                                                        improve
                                                        the chatbot's usability and effectiveness while
                                                        continuing to
                                                        give customers a useful tool to improve their cooking
                                                        and
                                                        meal-planning experiences.<br><br>
                                                        The development of the chatbot demonstrated how AI
                                                        technology
                                                        can drive Human Computer Interaction to develop creative
                                                        solutions to pressing challenges. The chatbot will
                                                        assist users in
                                                        reducing food waste,
                                                        saving time, and choosing healthier meals by utilizing
                                                        AI to
                                                        suggest recipes based on items that were readily
                                                        available.
                                                        I feel that the project emphasized how crucial it is to
                                                        develop
                                                        chatbots with the user's experience in mind. We were
                                                        able to
                                                        develop a chatbot that was simple to use, produced
                                                        accurate and
                                                        helpful results, and was intuitive by incorporating user
                                                        feedback and human-centered design concepts.
                                                        We realized that to further improve the functionality
                                                        and
                                                        usability of any project, we need to keep an eye on user
                                                        input
                                                        in the future and
                                                        make changes accordingly, as they are the final judges
                                                        of our product. Recognizing that technology is
                                                        continuously
                                                        changing, we need to be dedicated to keeping up with the
                                                        most
                                                        recent
                                                        developments to make sure that our our projects
                                                        continues to be
                                                        a useful tool for consumers. This is why I feel user's
                                                        feedback is of utmost priority.<br><br>
                                                        Chris and I also created some amazing story boards
                                                        screenshots
                                                        of which are attached here: -<br>

                                                        Through this project, I have realized that to create a
                                                        chatbot
                                                        that is human-centered, it is essential to incorporate
                                                        user
                                                        feedback. Additionally, I also realized that the
                                                        creation of a
                                                        positive user experience is the main objective of
                                                        human-centered
                                                        design. The chatbot should be created to be
                                                        user-friendly,
                                                        intuitive, and to deliver results cater to their
                                                        needs. Finally, I also realized that the development of
                                                        an
                                                        efficient and user-friendly chatbot requires an
                                                        iterative design
                                                        process, which can expand our thinking horizons.<br><br>
                                                        My group's work on the presentation looks outstanding.
