                                                        year's resolution. I had my first class on Human Computer
                                                        Interaction on 6<sup>th</sup> February 2023. It was a really
                                                        interesting lecture as I always wondered about the heuristics

                                                        sparked in me the basic understanding of human perspective to

                                                        it's mostly project based, which makes it look so fun!</p>

                                                        wanted to stay on top of this, so while having lunch today at
                                                        Passion, I spoke with a few friends of mine about what potential
                                                        problems they have faced throughout their stay at UST. I got
                                                        really interesting feedback from my friends. Quite a lot of
                                                        problems at UST haha! I'm not much of a gymmer, but one of my
                                                        friends is and he was so passionate about the need to reform the
                                                        gym system. I felt so intrigued hearing that and was totally
                                                        convinced that this is the topic I want to work on. But again,
                                                        like I said, I'm not a gymmer, so I didn't relate strongly with
                                                        the topic. Another friend of mine suggested that it's so
                                                        annoying when they feel like studying and decide to sit in the
                                                        library, travel all the way from their halls to the LC, only to
                                                        find out that it's at capacity and there's no more seating
                                                        available. Well, this problem could have been easily solved by
                                                        counting the number of Student ID taps on their entry system,

                                                        be a possible project to work on. Another one of my friends
                                                        suggested to improve the HKUST AirCon recharging system as it's
                                                        a three step process which is pretty annoying, however, TKO
                                                        Hall, in which I live in, has already simplified the system by
                                                        making use of Octopus Cards instead.</p>

                                                        Today, I had an interesting interaction with one of my friends,
                                                        he recently broke up with his girlfriend and were super sad as
                                                        they also missed the deadline for USThing's Valentine's Match.
                                                        He was very sad. While I consoled him, I also got the idea of
                                                        reforming the USThing Valentine's Matchmaking by decentralizing
                                                        the user profiles and making the match making process more
                                                        transparent. I ended up pitching this idea to my groupmates
                                                        which got all of us very excited as it clearly caters to the
                                                        huge number of single people at HKUST. But since, a lot of my
                                                        groupmates are exchange students and have no idea whatsoever
                                                        about USThing's Valentine's Day Matchmaking, we had to drop the
                                                        idea. We also discussed if we could work on UST's laundry
                                                        system, as similar to the AirCon system, it's pretty outdated.
                                                        But again, in my JCH, it's pretty convenient. So we decided to
                                                        drop the idea.

                                                        Today, we had the in-class activity where we are supposed to
                                                        brainstorm on ideas and create our mindmap. We had very limited
                                                        time, so we made use of our research and interactions so far to
                                                        make the mindmap as quickly as we could. This is what we came up
                                                        with: - <br>

                                                        Here we also thought that we could revamp the Student
                                                        Information System or SIS, but we realized that it was a really
                                                        common topic when other groups presented. We were all very
                                                        tired, so we decided to have lunch at the LG1 canteen. But there
                                                        was a massive crowd there as it was peak lunch hours. We
                                                        couldn't even find a single empty table to accomodate our group.
                                                        And that's when we zeroed down to working on <b>Enhancing HKUST
                                                                Canteen Experience</b>. We realized that we're not the
                                                        only ones facing the problem, there's hundreds of other students
                                                        who're so tired of the lack of information HKUST's Canteens
                                                        provide. So we decided to send develop our questionnaire and
                                                        send it out to our groupchats to gather people's perspective and
                                                        validate if our experiences match theirs. By the end of the day,
                                                        we were able to create the following google form to survey

                                                        Based on the responses we collected, I was able to ideate
                                                        another mindmap to fit this particular problem of
                                                        non-user-friendly canteen experience. It looks like this: -<br>

                                                        Based off the questionnaire, I was able to assess what kind of
                                                        persona our users have, those who primarily belong to the
                                                        student group. I came up with the following characteristics that

                                                The questionnaire also allowed me to identify problems related to the

                                                        This also made me ponder what's the best way to implement this
                                                        reform,
                                                        should I create a new application, maybe create a virtual
                                                        queuing
                                                        system, what about work with just a single vendor, maybe just
                                                        focus of
                                                        availabiliy of seats system, etc. I realized that this all can
                                                        be
                                                        combined into a single page on HKUST Student's App which is
                                                        already
                                                        installed in most of our primary user's (students) devices. A
                                                        simple
                                                        task breakdown would invlove pitching a collaboration with HKUST
                                                        Student's Application, collect statistics to validate our
                                                        claims,
                                                        collaborate with the canteen vendors, configure their POS
                                                        systems to
                                                        push information about stock to our API which we develop to
                                                        standardize
                                                        information transmission. And finally design a page in HKUST
                                                        Student's
                                                        App that can connect with this information. This clear approach
                                                        of working systematically and getting to know your customers and
                                                        their behaviour was pretty important to me as I was able to
                                                        solve a lot of questions I was getting while I was simply
                                                        thinking of the idea. Who better to ask for answers than the
                                                        users themselves! We then started working on our storyboarding
                                                        and presentation.

                                                        My group has done a fantastic job in working on the
                                                        presentations. We were able to build the story boards, thanks to
                                                        my groupmates and were able to complete the presentation on
                                                        time. @Lauren and @Tiffany came up with fabulous designs for the
                                                        storyboards: -<br>

                                                        Overall, it was a really fun experience where I got to
                                                        learn a lot about human-centered design and how user experience
                                                        needs to be enhanced and also that it's a continuous experience
                                                        that should always be supplimented with user feedback surveys in
                                                        order to incorporate the dynamics of changing utility with time!
